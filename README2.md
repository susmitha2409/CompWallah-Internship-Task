# Health Insurance Premium Prediction

This project aims to predict health insurance premiums using machine learning regression models.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains information about individuals' age, sex, BMI, number of children, smoking habits, region, and insurance charges.

## Preprocessing

- Normalized continuous features (age, BMI, charges) using Min-Max scaling.
- Encoded categorical features (sex, region, smoker) using label encoding.

## Models Implemented

- Decision Tree Regression
- Random Forest Regression
- Gradient Boosting Regression

## Usage

To run the code:
- Install the required libraries listed in the `requirements.txt` file.
- Run the `health_insurance_prediction.py` script.
